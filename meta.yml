  Coq formalization of validating labelled state transition
  and message production systems

description: |-
  A validating labelled state transition and message production system
  (VLSM) abstractly models a distributed system with faults. This project
  contains a formalization of VLSMs and their theory in the Coq proof assistant.

build: |-
  ## Building instructions

  We recommend using [opam](https://opam.ocaml.org) to install project dependencies.
  Besides the basic building instructions below, we also provide a more detailed
  [building guide](BUILDING.md), with special recommendations for Windows users.

  To install the project dependencies via opam, do:

  ```shell
  opam repo add coq-released https://coq.inria.fr/opam/released
  opam install coq.8.18.0 coq-stdpp.1.9.0 coq-itauto coq-equations
  ```

  To build the project when you have all dependencies installed, do:

  ```shell
  git clone https://github.com/runtimeverification/vlsm.git
  cd vlsm
  make   # or make -j <number-of-cores-on-your-machine>
  ```

  ## Documentation

  ### File organization

  - [Lib](theories/Lib): Extensions to the [Coq standard library](https://coq.inria.fr/stdlib/) and [Coq-std++](https://gitlab.mpi-sws.org/iris/stdpp/).
  - [Core](theories/Core): Core VLSM definitions and results.
  - [Examples](theories/Examples): Applications of VLSMs, including tutorials.

  ### Source documentation

  - [latest coqdoc presentation of the Coq files](https://runtimeverification.github.io/vlsm-docs/latest/coqdoc/toc.html)
  - [latest Alectryon presentation the Coq files](https://runtimeverification.github.io/vlsm-docs/latest/alectryon/toc.html)

  ### Tutorials

  - [VLSMs that Generate Logical Formulas](theories/Examples/Tutorial/Formulas.v): construction of VLSMs corresponding to propositional logic symbols, with their composition having well-formed propositional formulas as valid messages.
  - [VLSMs that Multiply](theories/Examples/Tutorial/Multiply.v): construction of VLSMs that perform arithmetic operations, with their composition having products of powers as valid messages.
  - [Primes Composition of VLSMs](theories/Examples/Tutorial/PrimesComposition.v): construction of an infinite family of VLSMs that multiply and their composition based on primes.
  - [Round-based asynchronous muddy children puzzle](theories/Examples/Tutorial/MuddyChildrenRounds.v): the [muddy children puzzle](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/dynamic-epistemic/appendix-B-solutions.html#muddy) as a constrained composition of VLSMs that communicate asynchronously in rounds.
